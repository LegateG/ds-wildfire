## Executive Summary: Wildfire Duration Analysis in Canada

This project provides a comprehensive data analysis and machine learning approach to understand the factors influencing wildfire duration in Canada. Leveraging a dataset of Canadian wildfires, this project aims to uncover key insights into how various environmental and geographical elements contribute to the time it takes to control a wildfire. This analysis serves as a strong demonstration of practical data science skills in a real-world context.

### Key Questions Addressed:
* What are the top factors that determine how long a fire will burn?
* Does a larger fire size always mean it will take longer to control?
* Are fires in British Columbia typically harder to control than those in Ontario, even when controlling for other factors?

### Project Highlights & Key Findings:

The analysis reveals that the primary driver for wildfire duration is the **region factor**, with Newfoundland & Labrador experiencing the longest control times. This is closely followed by the **month**, indicating strong seasonality, with longer durations observed in the second half of the year. Latitude also plays a significant role.

While a larger fire generally takes longer to control, the project demonstrates that small wildfires do not necessarily equate to easier control. Furthermore, wildfires in British Columbia show a stronger correlation with control time compared to those in Ontario, even when other factors are considered.

### Skills Demonstrated:
* **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Handling date conversions, filtering relevant data, and addressing data quality issues.
* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new, insightful variables like 'days_to_control' and 'month' from raw data.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing and understanding data distributions and relationships.
* **Machine Learning Model Development:** Utilizing a RandomForestRegressor for predictive modeling.
* **Model Interpretability (SHAP):** Employing SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to interpret model predictions and identify feature importance, providing actionable business insights.
* **Statistical Analysis:** Drawing conclusions and answering specific business questions based on data analysis.
* **Python Programming:** Efficiently using Python for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

### Python Libraries Used:
* **pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
* **numpy:** For numerical operations.
* **matplotlib.pyplot:** For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
* **seaborn:** For creating informative and attractive statistical graphics.
* **scikit-learn (sklearn):** For machine learning tasks, including model selection (`train_test_split`), preprocessing (`ColumnTransformer`, `OneHotEncoder`, `StandardScaler`), pipeline creation (`Pipeline`), ensemble methods (`RandomForestRegressor`), and model evaluation (`mean_absolute_error`).
* **shap:** For explaining the output of machine learning models, providing crucial interpretability.
